`Merge/OEWS_agg.csv` is too large to be uploaded to github, you can generate it yourself by running the script importOEWS.R or unzip `Merge/OEWS_agg.zip.csv`


`Data/NCS_wage/nw.series.txt` and `Data/NCS_wage/nw.series.txt` are also too large to be uploaded. Please download the two text files from this website <a href = "https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/nw/">https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/nw/</a> and move them to Data/NCS_wage. If the file names are not named correctly post-download, rename them accordingly. 

2011-2020 raw data for the OEWS survey could not be uploaded due to size limitations, but you can unzip the zip files to extract the data. The zip files are located in OEWS
