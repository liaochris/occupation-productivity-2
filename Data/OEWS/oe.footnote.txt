1	Estimates for detailed occupations do not sum to the totals because the totals include occupations not shown separately. Estimates do not include self-employed workers.
2	Annual wages have been calculated by multiplying the corresponding hourly wage by 2,080 hours.
3	The relative standard error (RSE) is a measure of the reliability of a survey statistic. The smaller the relative standard error, the more precise the estimate.
4	Wages for some occupations that do not generally work year-round, full time, are reported either as hourly wages or annual salaries depending on how they are typically paid.
5	This wage is equal to or greater than $100.00 per hour or $208,000 per year.
