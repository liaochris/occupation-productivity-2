Obtaining OEWS Estimates in Electronic Format


Two types of OEWS estimates can be downloaded directly from this website in Excel (XLS) format:

      Occupational employment and wage estimates by geographic area (National, State, Metropolitan,
      and Nonmetropolitan Area)

      National Occupational employment and wage estimates by industry (sector, 3-, 4-, and 
5-digit North American Industry Classification System levels)

In addition to the estimates that can be downloaded directly from this website, historical 
OEWS estimates are available upon request through the contact information above.  Historical 
OEWS estimates consist of the 1988 to 1997 national occupational employment and wage data by 
industry, for most industries at the 2- and 3-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 
levels. Estimates for 1988 - 1995 contain only employment data.  Estimates for 1997 contain 
employment and wage data. Between 1988 and 1995 covered industries were surveyed once in a 
three-year cycle.  The OEWS program now surveys all covered industries each year.    

Note: 1996 estimates are not available.
