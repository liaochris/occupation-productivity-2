===================================================================================

The following is a definition of:  Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OE)

Survey Description:  The Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program conducts a 
semi-annual mail survey designed to produce estimates of employment and wages for specific 
occupations. The OEWS program collects data on wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments 
in order to produce employment and wage estimates for about 800 occupations. Data from 
self-employed persons are not collected and are not included in the estimates. The OEWS program 
produces these occupational estimates by geographic area and by industry. Estimates based on 
geographic areas are available at the National, State, Metropolitan, and Nonmetropolitan Area levels. The Bureau 
of Labor Statistics produces occupational employment and wage estimates for over 450 industry 
classifications at the national level. The industry classifications correspond to the sector, 
3-, 4-, and 5-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industrial groups. 

Summary Data Available:  Cross-industry estimates are available by Nation, State, and
metropolitan area for about 800 occupations.  Industry specific estimates are available
at the National level for over 450 industries.  

Data Characteristics:  Annual wage estimates are rounded to the nearest dollar and are stored 
with no decimal place.  

Hourly wage estimates are rounded to the nearest cent and are stored with two decimal places. 

Employment estimates are rounded to the nearest ten and are stored with no decimal place.

Percent relative standard errors are rounded to the nearest tenth and are stored with one decimal 
place.

Special characteristics of the data are footnoted where necessary. 

Updating Schedule:  The OEWS estimates are updated annually, normally in March.

Section 3
=================================================================================
The definition of a time series, its relationship to and the interrelationship
among series, data and mapping files is detailed below:


The FTP files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series 
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series.  
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes contained within each series
identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define
oe.series.  Note the Field Numbers are for reference only; they do not exist in the
database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are separated by 
spaces; the first record of each file contains the column headers for the data 
elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character. 

Field #/Data Element		Length		Value(Example)		

1.  series_id		  	30		OEUM000040000000000000001

2.  seasonal		 	1		U

3.  areatype_code	  	1 		M

4.  industry_code 	  	6		000000

5.  occupation_code 	  	6		000000 
    
6.  datatype_code	  	2		01

7.  state_code	  		2		01

8.  area_code		 	7		0000400

9.  sector_code			6		11--12

10.  series_title		2KB		Employment for All Occupations in All Industries in Albany, GA

11.  footnote_codes		10		1

12.  begin_year		   	4		1980

14.  end_year		   	4		2002		

15.  end_period		   	3		A01


The series_id (OEUM000040000000000000001) can be broken out into:

Code					Value(Example)

survey abbreviation	=		OE
seasonal(code)		=		U
areatype-code		=		M
area_code		=		0000400
industry_code		=		000000
occupation_code		=		000000 
datatype_code		=		01

Section 5
==================================================================================
File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define
each data file.  Note that the field numbers are for reference only; they do not 
exist in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are 
separated by spaces; the first record of each file contains the column headers for 
the data elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character.  

The oe.data file is partitioned separate files:  

	1.  oe.data.1.AllData		- All year-to-date data
	2.  oe.data.0.Current		- All current year-to-date data
	

Both of the above data files have the following format:

1. series_id		  30		OEUM000040000000000000001

2. year			   4		1980	

3. period		   3		S01		

4. value		  12      	56290				 

5. footnote_codes	  10		2
				

The series_id (OEUM000040000000000000001) can be broken out into:

Code					Value(Example)

survey abbreviation	=		OE

File Structure and Format:  The following represents the file format used to define
each mapping file. Note that the field numbers are for reference only; they do not
exist in the database.  Mapping files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are
separated by tabs; the first record of each file contains the column headers for the
data elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character.
