Section 1: Survey definition
=======================================================================

The following is a definition of: Modeled Wage Estimates (WM)

Survey Description:  The Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) and 
National Compensation Survey (NCS) programs have produced estimates by 
borrowing from the strength and breadth of each survey to provide more 
details on occupational wages than either program provides individually.
Modeled wage estimates provide annual estimates of average hourly 
wages for occupations by selected job characteristics and within 
geographical location. The job characteristics include bargaining status 
(union and nonunion), part- and full-time work status, incentive- and 
time-based pay, and work levels by occupation.

Direct estimates are based on survey responses only from the particular 
geographic area to which the estimate refers. In contrast, modeled wage 
estimates use survey responses from larger areas to fill in information 
for smaller areas where the sample size is not sufficient to produce 
direct estimates. Modeled wage estimates require the assumption that the 
patterns to responses in the larger area hold in the smaller area.

The sample size for the NCS is not large enough to produce direct estimates 
by area, occupation, and job characteristic for all of the areas for which 
the OEWS publishes estimates by area and occupation. The NCS sample consists 
of 6 private industry panels with approximately 3,300 establishments sampled 
per panel, and 1,600 sampled state and local government units. The OEWS full 
six-panel sample consists of nearly 1.2 million establishments. 

The sample establishments are classified in industry categories based on the 
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Within an 
establishment, specific job categories are selected to represent broader 
occupational definitions. Jobs are classified according to the Standard 
Occupational Classification (SOC) system; in a few cases, classification 
reflects aggregation to an OEWS-specific occupational grouping.

Summary Data Available: Average hourly wage estimates for civilian workers 
in occupations by job characteristic and work levels. These data are available 
at the national, state, metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan area levels.

Frequency of Observations: Data are available on an annual basis, 
typically in May. 

Data Characteristics: All hourly wages are published to the nearest cent.

Section 3: Series file, data files, and mapping files definitions and 
relationships
=======================================================================

The interrelationship among series, data, and mapping files is detailed 
below:

The download files are organized such that data users are provided with 
three types of files:

a) a series file (only one series file per survey)
b) data files
c) mapping files


The series file contains a unique series identification code that identifies 
a single series and columns of codes that define the series. 
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level 
information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 


The data files contain one line of data for each observation period 
pertaining to a specific series identification code.


The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text 
descriptions that correspond to each of the various codes used to define 
each series identification code.

=======================================================================
Section 4: Series file format and field definitions
=======================================================================

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used
to define the wm.series file. Note that the Field Numbers are for 
reference only; they do not exist in the database. Series files are in ASCII 
text format. Data elements are separated by tabs; the first record of each 
file contains the column headers for the data elements stored in each field.
Each record ends with a new line character.

1.      series_id         29          WMU00107401020000001300002700

Section 6: Mapping file formats and field definitions
=======================================================================

File Structure and Format:  The following represents the file format 
used to define each mapping file. Note that the field numbers are for 
reference only; they do not exist in the database. Mapping files are 
in ASCII text format. Data elements are separated by tabs; the first 
record of each file contains the column headers for the data elements 
stored in each field. Each record ends with a new line character.

NOTE: Mapping files contain three additional fields which are not 
referenced below: display_level, selectable, and sort_sequence. 
These fields are used for BLS purposes and may be ignored.
