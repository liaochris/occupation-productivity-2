The following is a definition of (as of 7/12/2017):
MAJOR SECTOR MULTIFACTOR PRODUCTIVITY (MP) 

Description: Multifactor productivity measures describe the relationship
between output in real terms and the inputs involved in its production.  The
multifactor productivity indexes for private business and private nonfarm
business are derived by dividing an output index by an index of labor input
and capital services.  Labor input and capital services are combined using
chained superlative Tornqvist aggregation, applying weights that represent
each component's share of total costs. The chained superlative Tornqvist index
uses changing weights; the share in each year is averaged with the preceding
year's share.  The multifactor productivity indexes are derived by dividing
an output index by an index of the combined inputs of labor, capital services,
energy, non-energy materials, and purchased business services.  The output
index for manufacturing is computed using a chained superlative index
(Tornqvist) of three-digit NAICS industry outputs. Industry output is measured
as sectoral output, the total value of goods and services leaving the industry.

This file contains MFP data on the following three major sectors; private 
business, private non-farm business, and total manufacturing.  These sectors are 
coded as private business = 4900, private nonfarm business = 4910, and 
manufacturing = 9900. There is also available nondurable manufacturing = 9910, 
durable manufacturing = 9920, and two-digit level manufacturing = 5000-5850.

Private business includes all activities measured in the national accounts 
with the exception of general government, the output of paid employees of 
private households and nonprofit institutions, the "rest of the world" 
sector, the gross housing product of owner-occupied dwellings, the 
statistical discrepancy, and government enterprises.

Private nonfarm business further excludes the farm sector.

For each sector, measures of industry analytic ratios (e.g., multifactor 
productivity, output per hour) are available as well as the basic data 
(e.g., hours, capital services) on which they are based.  Data are obtained
and derived from the following sources:  Current Employment Statistics 
program (BLS), Current Population Survey (BLS), Work Survey (BLS), Censuses
and Annual Surveys of Manufactures (Census Bureau), National Income and 
Product Accounts (BEA), and the Land Stock Data from the Department of 
Agriculture.

Summary Data Available:  There are 205 major sector and 848 two-digit multifactor 
productivity series available on the LABSTAT database.  Private Business and
Private Nonfarm Business Measures start in 1987.  Manufacturing measures start
in 1987.

Frequency of Observations:  Series are available on an annual basis.

Base Period:  Private Business and Private Nonfarm Business indexes have a base
period of 2009 = 100.  Manufacturing indexes have a base period of 2009=100.

Data Characteristics:  Indexes are stored to three decimal places. 

Updating Schedule:  Updates are performed annually as data becomes available. 
Traditionally, all revisions to source data are reflected in the following
release.

Section 3
=================================================================================
The definition of a time series, its relationship to and the interrelationship
among series, data and mapping files is detailed below:

A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period of time
over consistent time intervals (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).  
BLS time series data are typically produced at monthly intervals and represent data 
ranging from a specific consumer item in a specific geographical area whose price 
is gathered monthly to a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment
rate is being recorded monthly, etc.

The FTP files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series 
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series.  
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes contained within each series
identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define 
mp.series.  Note that the Field Numbers are for reference only; they do not exist 
in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are separated 
by tabs; the first record of each file contains the column headers for the data
elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character.

Data downloads on the BLS website are based on a unique series identifier called the "Series ID". A Series ID is generated according to predictable
rules and generally do not change over time. A Series ID allows customers to download a particular measure or group of measures quickly and easily
