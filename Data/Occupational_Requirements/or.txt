Section 1 : Survey definition
===================================================================================================

The Occupational Requirements Survey (ORS) is an establishment-based survey conducted by the U.S. 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The ORS publishes job-related information regarding physical 
demands; environmental conditions; education, training, and experience; as well as cognitive and 
mental requirements.  

ORS estimate characteristics: The ORS includes job requirements necessary to perform critical tasks
in support of critical job functions. Critical job functions must be integral to a job and form the
primary factors of pay. Education in the ORS provides the minimum education required to perform a
job, not the education attainment of the worker. For example, a job may require a bachelor’s degree,
but workers performing the job may have more advanced degrees, such as a doctoral degree (Ph.D.).
For the purposes of ORS, the requirement is a bachelor’s degree. The distinction is significant
because the objective is to measure job requirements not the characteristics of the workers.

Classification systems: Establishments are classified using the 2017 North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS). Occupations are classified using the 2018 Standard Occupation 
Classification (SOC) system. 

Sample: The sample responding information is available in the latest ORS news release technical 
note available at www.bls.gov/news.release/ors.nr0.htm.

Summary estimates available: Published estimates are for civilian workers (private industry and 
state and local government workers), occupational groups, and 6-digit occupations. Due to 
publication criteria or data unavailability, not all elements are available for each occupation, 
or occupational group. 

Update schedule: Estimates are updated annually for each reference year and are considered 
preliminary until the 2023 reference year estimates are published. The final estimates will combine
results from five sample groups.

Additional information can be found at www.bls.gov/ors.

===================================================================================================
Section 3 : Series file, data files, mapping file definitions, and relationships
===================================================================================================

The download files are organized such that ORS users are provided with the following:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  data files
c)  mapping files

The series file contains a unique series identification code that identifies a single series and 
columns of codes that define the series. Additionally, the series file also contains the following 
series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation. 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 

Note: a period value of A01 corresponds to annual data

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a specific 
series. Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed 
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions that correspond 
to each of the various codes used to define each series identification code.

Section 4 : Series file format and field definitions
===================================================================================================

File structure and format: The following represents the file format used to define the or.series 
file. Note the field numbers are for reference only, they do not exist in the database. Data 
elements are separated by tabs. The first record of each file contains the column headers for the 
data elements stored in each field. Each record ends with a new line character. 

Field #/data element			Length		Value (example)

1. series_id		  		20		ORUC1000000000001197

2. seasonal				1		U

3. ownership_code	  		1 		1

The series_id (ORUC1000000000001197) can be broken out into:

Code							Value (example)

Survey abbreviation			=		OR
Seasonal(code)				=		U
Requirement_code			=		C
Ownership_code				=		1
Industry_code				=		0000
