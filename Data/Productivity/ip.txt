Section 1
================================================================================
The following is a definition of:  INDUSTRY PRODUCTIVITY (IP) 

Survey Description:  The Industry Productivity program produces annual 
measures of output per hour, unit labor costs, and related series for a 
select group of U.S. industries.

Time-Series Available:  Indexes and annual percent changes are available by 
industry for labor productivity (output per hour), output per person, real 
output, the implicit price deflator for output, labor hours, employment, 
labor compensation, and unit labor costs.  Level data underlying the 
productivity and cost measures - including nominal value of production, labor 
compensation, total annual hours, and total annual employment - also are 
available. 

Frequency of Observations:  Series are available on an annual basis, and 
therefore, are not seasonally adjusted. For most industries, the indexes 
begin in 1987 and annual percent change time-series begin in 1988.  

Base Periods:  The base period for the industry productivity and related 
indexes is 2002 = 100.

Update Schedule:  Updates are performed periodically throughout the year as 
source data become available. Typically, updates are announced through 3 to 4 
news releases each year, with each news release covering industries in a 
different sector or combination of sectors, such that all industries are 
updated at least once a year.

Measures" (see: http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/homch11.htm).

Section 3
=================================================================================
The definition of a time series, its relationship to and the interrelationship
among series, data and mapping files is detailed below:

A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period of time
over consistent time intervals (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).  
BLS time series data are typically produced at monthly intervals and represent data 
ranging from a specific consumer item in a specific geographical area whose price 
is gathered monthly to a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment
rate is being recorded monthly, etc.

The FTP files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series 
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series.  
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes contained within each series
identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define 
ip.series.  Note that the Field Numbers are for reference only; they do not exist 
in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are separated 
by tabs; the first record of each file contains the column headers for the data
elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character. 

Field #/Data Element	Length		Value(Example)		

1.  series_id		  17		IPUBN211___L000

2.  seasonal		  1		U

3.  sector_code		  1		B

4.  industry_code	  7		N211___  

5.  measure_code	  3		L00

6.  duration_code	  1		0

7.  base_year		  4		1997					

8.  begin_year		  4		1987

9.  begin_period	  3		A01

10.  end_year		  4		2001

11. end_period		  3		A01


The series_id (IPUBN211___L000) can be broken out into:

Code					Value

survey abbreviation	=		IP
seasonal (code) 	=		U
sector_code		=		B
industry_code		=		N211___
measure_code		=		L00
duration_code		=		0

Section 5
==================================================================================
File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define
each data file.  Note that the field numbers are for reference only; they do not 
exist in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are 
separated by tabs; the first record of each file contains the column headers for 
the data elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character. 

The ip.data file is partitioned into two separate files:

	1.  ip.data.0.Current	- All current year-to-date
	2.  ip.data.1.AllData	- All data

The above-named data files have the following format:

Field #/Data Element	Length		Value(Example)		

1. series_id		  17		IPUBN211___L000 	      	

2. year			   4		2001	

3. period		   3		A01		

4. value		  12      	116.6	 	
				 
5. footnote_codes	  10		It varies
				

The series_id (IPUBN211___L000) can be broken out into:

Code					Value

survey abbreviation	=		IP
seasonal (code) 	=		U
sector_code		=		B
industry_code		=		N211___
measure_code		=		L00
duration_code		=		0
