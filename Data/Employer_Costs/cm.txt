Section 1: Survey Definition
=======================================================================================

The following is a definition of: Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (CM)

Survey Description: The Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC) is a measure
of the cost of labor. The compensation series includes wages and salaries plus employer
costs for individual employee benefits. Employee benefit costs are calculated as cost-
per-hour-worked for individual benefits ranging from employer payments for Social 
Security to paid time off for holidays.

The survey covers all occupations in the civilian economy, which includes the total 
private economy (excluding farms and households), and the public sector (excluding the 
federal government). Statistics are published for the private and public sectors 
separately, and the data are combined in a measure for the civilian economy.

The data are collected from a probability sample of about 27,200 occupations with 6,600 
sample establishments in private industry and about 8,000 occupations within 1,400 
state and local government establishments. The sample establishments are classified in 
industry categories based on the North American Industrial Classification System 
(NAICS). Within an establishment, specific job categories are selected to represent 
broader occupational definitions. Jobs are classified according to the Standard 
Occupational Classification (SOC) system. 

Summary Data Available: For private industry workers, data are 
available for total compensation costs, for wages and salaries alone, and 
for individual benefit costs alone. Data are available by major occupational
and industry groups, as well as by census region, census division, and bargaining 
status. Annual estimates of the 15 largest metropolitan areas are published for the 
March reference for total compensation, wages and salaries, as well as total benefits.

For state and local government and civilian workers data are available for major 
occupational and selected industry series. 

Frequency of Observations: Data are available on a quarterly basis.

Data Characteristics: All costs per hour worked are published to the nearest
cent. All percents are published to one decimal place (including relative standard 
errors).

Updating Schedule: Updates are available about ten weeks following the end
of the reference period. Reference periods are the months of March, June, September,
and December.

Section 3: Series file, data files, and mapping files definitions and relationships
=======================================================================================

The interrelationship among series, data, and mapping files is detailed below:

The series file contains a unique series identification code that identifies a single 
time series and columns of codes that define the series. Additionally, the series file 
also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation

The download files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  data files
c)  mapping files

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes used to define each series
identification code.

Section 4: Series file format and field definitions
=======================================================================================

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define the 
cm.series file. Note that the Field Numbers are for reference only; they do not exist 
in the database. Data element are separated by tabs; the first record of each file 
contains the column headers for the data elements stored in each field. Each record 
ends with a new line character. 

Field #/Data Element	Length		Value(Example)		

1.  series_id		  17		CMU1010000100000P

2.  seasonal		   1		U

3.  owner_code		   1		1

4.  industry_code	   6		000000

5.  occupation_code	   6		000000	
						
6.  subcell_code	   2		00	
						
7.  area_code		   5		99999

8.  datatype_code	   1		P

9.  estimate_code	   2 		01		

10. series_title	   250		(descriptive label text)

11. footnote_codes	   10		3

12. begin_year		   4		2008

13. begin_period	   3		Q01		
				
14. end_year		   4		2012		

15. end_period		   3		Q04		


The series_id (CMU1010000100000P) can be broken out into:

Code					Value(Example)

survey abbreviation	=		CM
seasonal (code)		=		U
owner_code		=		1
industry_code		=		0000
occupation_code		=		100
subcell_code 		=		00
datatype_code		=		P

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define
each data file. Note that the field numbers are for reference only; they do not 
exist in the database. Data files are in ASCII text format. Data elements are 
separated by tabs; the first record of each file contains the column headers for 
the data elements stored in each field. Each record ends with a new line character. 

The cm.data file is partitioned into three separate files:
