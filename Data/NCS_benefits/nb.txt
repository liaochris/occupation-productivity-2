Section 1: Survey definition 
===============================================================================

Survey Description: The National Compensation Survey provides comprehensive 
measures of compensation cost trends and the coverage, costs, and provisions
of employer-sponsored benefits in the United States. Estimates include 
incidence and key provisions of employer-sponsored benefits for civilian 
workers, private industry workers, as well as state and local government 
workers by worker and establishment characteristics. Detailed health and 
retirement provisions are also published. 

The survey covers occupations in the civilian economy, which includes the 
total private economy (excluding farms and households), and the public sector
(excluding the federal government). Statistics are published for the private
and public sectors separately, and the data are combined in a measure for the
civilian economy.

For more information about the sample size, see the technical note section of
the Employee Benefits in the United States news release
www.bls.gov/news.release/ebs2.nr0.htm. The sampled establishments are 
classified in industry categories based on the North American Industrial 
Classification System (NAICS). Within an establishment, specific jobs are 
selected and are classified according to the Standard Occupational 
Classification (SOC) system.

Section 3: Series file, data files, and mapping files definitions and 
relationships
===============================================================================

The series file contains a unique series identification code for each 
published series and columns of associated codes defining the code segments.
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level 
information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation

The following set of files are provided:

a) a series file (only one series file per survey)
b) data files
c) mapping files

The data files contain the series ids, reference period, measures of 
reliability, and estimates. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text 
descriptions which correspond to each of the various codes used to define 
each series identification code.

===============================================================================
Section 4: Series file format and field definitions
===============================================================================

The following represents the file format used to define the nb.series file. 
Note that the field numbers are for reference only; they do not exist in the 
database. Data elements are separated by tabs. The first record of each file 
contains the column headers for the data elements stored in each field. Each 
record ends with a new line character. 

File Name: nb.series
Field #/Data Element		Length	    	Value(Example)		

1. series_id			23		NBU10000000000000028007

2. seasonal			1		U	

3. ownership_code	 	1		1		

4. estimate_code		2	      	00	

5. industry_code	 	6		000000

6. ocupational_code	 	6		000000

7. subcell_code	 		2		00

8. datatype_code	 	2		28

14. end_year	 		4		2019

15. end_period	 		3		A01


The series_id (NBU20530000000000033030) can be broken out into:

Code					Value
survey abbreviation		=	NB
seasonal(code)			=	U
ownership_code			=	2
estimate_code			=	05
industry_code			=	3000
occupation_code			=	000000
subcell_code			=	00
datatype_code			=	33
provision_code			=	030

Section 5: Data file formats and field definitions
===============================================================================

The following represents the file format used to define each data file. Note 
that the field numbers are for reference only; they do not exist in the 
database. Data files are in ASCII text format. Data elements are separated by 
tabs. The first record of each file contains the column headers for the data 
elements stored in each field. Each record ends with a new line character. 

The nb.data file is partitioned into two separate files:  
 
	1. nb.data.1.AllData	- All estimates
	2. nb.aspect		- All available standard errors
