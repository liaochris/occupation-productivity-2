The following is a definition of: National Compensation Survey (NW)

Survey Description:  The National Compensation Survey (NCS) program 
produces information on wages by occupation for many metropolitan areas 
and also for the Nation as a whole.  Wage rates for different work 
levels within occupation groups also are published.  Data are available 
for private industry, State and local governments, full-time workers, 
part-time workers, and other workforce characteristics.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) selects a sample of 
establishments in both the private sector and State and local 
governments in over 150 metropolitan areas and non-metropolitan 
counties throughout the United States.  Data are collected from all 
establishments in a specified area over a period of a few months.  NCS 
data are used by both private companies and government agencies to help 
set pay and to compare their wages with those of other employers.  The 
data are a major component of the pay-setting process for Federal 
Government employees.  Economic and academic researchers also are 
interested in the findings.
 
Summary Data Available:  The NCS Wage query presents mean hourly wage 
data for all workers in an occupation (private industry and State and 
local government combined).  Currently, data may be obtained for over 
85 geographical areas, on a National level, and by the 9 census divisions 
as they are defined by BLS.

Data Characteristics: Hourly wages are stored to two decimal places.

Section 3

The definition of a time series, its relationship to and the 
interrelationship among series, data and mapping files is detailed 
below:

A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period 
of time over consistent time intervals (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-
annually, annually). BLS time series data are typically produced at 
monthly intervals and represent data ranging from a specific consumer 
item in a specific geographical area whose price is gathered monthly to 
a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment rate is 
being recorded monthly, etc.

The FTP files are organized such that data users are provided with the 
following set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a 
series identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single 
time series. Additionally, the series file also contains the following 
series-level information:

a)  the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data 
observation. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text 
descriptions that correspond to each of the various codes contained 
within each series identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period 
pertaining to a specific time series.  Each line contains a reference
to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual 
averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used 
to define nw.series.  Note the Field Numbers are for reference only; 
they do not exist in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  
Data elements are separated by spaces; the first record of each file 
contains the column headers for the data elements stored in each field.  
Each record ends with a new line character. 

Field #/Data Element			Length		Value(Example)		

1.  series_id       		       	30		NWU371674020200000000002505000

2.  state_code      			2 		37		

3.  area_code       			5		16740

The series_id (NWU371674020200000000002505000) can be broken out into:

Code					Value

survey abbreviation		=	NW
State Code			=	37
Area Code			=	16740
Ownership Code			=	2
Estimate ID Code		=	02
Industry Code			=	0000
Occupation Code			=	000000
Subcell ID Code			=	25
Data Type Code			=	05
Work Level/Supervisory Code	=	00

=======================================================================

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format 
used to define each data file.  Note that the field numbers are for 
reference only; they do not exist in the database.  Data files are 
in ASCII text format.  Data elements are separated by spaces; the 
first record of each file contains the column headers for the data 
elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line 
character. 

The NW.data file is partitioned into two separate files: 

	1. NW.data.0.Current	- All current year-to-date data
	2. NW.data.1.AllData	- All data


Both of the above data files have the following format:

Field #/Data Element		Length	    	Value(Example)		

1. series_id			30		NW

2. reference year		4		2005	

3. reference period	 	3		M06		

4. estimate value		12      	22.67	

5. published		 	1		P

6. footnote_codes		10		varies
				

The series_id (NWU371674020200000000002505000) can be broken out into:
